Online Auction Platform with React and ExpressJS Framework.

In the digital era, traditional auction systems have evolved into dynamic online platforms where buyers and sellers from across the globe can interact in real-time to buy and sell goods through competitive bidding. This project focuses on developing a modern online auction platform using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend, offering a seamless and real-time auction experience. The platform will allow sellers to list products and buyers to place bids, all while providing secure payments, user-friendly interfaces, and scalable performance.
